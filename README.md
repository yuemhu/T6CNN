# T6CNNï¼šA genome-scale prediction tool for bacterial type VI secreted effector proteins based on convolutional neural networks

## Set up

The standalone version of T6CNN has been tested in Linux.

Before using the T6CNN, please ensure that Python has been installed in your server. 
Please check the `requirements.txt` file for more details on required Python packages. You can create new environment and install all required packages with:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Using T6CNN

```shell
python T6CNN.py -p feature_matrix.txt -f sequence.fa -pr 'model prefix' -d CUDA
```

## Testing Result

We have compared T6CNN with existing prediction tools according to the perfomance on an independent test set(28 T6SEs + 185 none-T6SEs).
